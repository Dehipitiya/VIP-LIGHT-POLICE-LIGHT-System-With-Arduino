# <div align="center"><b><i> VIP LIGHT POLICE LIGHT System With Arduino </i></b></div>

This project demonstrates how to simulate different light patterns using an Arduino and LEDs. The system uses one red and one blue LED to simulate a VIP and police light system. The red LED represents a slowly blinking VIP light, while the blue LED represents a rapidly blinking police light, creating the effect of a flashing siren.
